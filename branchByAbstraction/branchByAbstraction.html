    <h1>Branch by Abstraction: A Gradual Approach to Code Changes</h1>

    <p>In the world of software development, making significant changes to your codebase can be a daunting task.
        Traditional methods like branching in source control or using conditional statements have their drawbacks. Enter
        "Branch by Abstraction,"<sup><a href="#ref1" class="reference">[1]</a></sup> a technique that offers a more gradual and manageable approach to implementing
        large-scale changes.</p>

    <h2>What is Branch by Abstraction?</h2>

    <p>Branch by Abstraction is a method that allows you to make substantial changes to your code incrementally, without
        resorting to long-lived feature branches. This technique was coined by Stacy Curl in 2007 and has since gained
        popularity among developers seeking a more flexible approach to code refactoring.</p>

This technique was coined by Stacy Curl in 2007 and has since gained popularity among developers seeking a more flexible approach to code refactoring.</p>

    <h2>The Benefits</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Encourages gradual change</li>
        <li>Allows for continuous integration</li>
        <li>Reduces the risk associated with big bang replacements</li>
        <li>Enables easier rollback if issues arise</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Implement Branch by Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Let's break down the process step by step:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Introduce an Abstraction</h2>
    <img src="images/step1.png" alt="Step 1: Introduce an Abstraction">
    <ol>
        <li>Create an abstraction layer over the code you plan to change. This is typically done by extracting an
            interface.
        </li>
        <li>Update all client code to use this new abstraction instead of calling the old code directly.</li>
        <li>Commit and push your changes. If your build passes, you're good to release.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 2: Implement the New Solution</h2>
    <img src="images/step2.png" alt="Step 2: Implement the New Solution">
    <ol>
        <li>Develop a new implementation of the abstraction, complete with tests to ensure functionality.</li>
        <li>Commit and push this new implementation. Again, if your build is green, you can release.</li>
        <li>Gradually update client code to use the new implementation (still via the abstraction).</li>
        <li>Commit and push these changes. Release if your build passes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 3: Clean Up</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Depending on how much of the old implementation you've migrated to the abstraction, consider deprecating or
            safely deleting the original implementation.
        </li>
        <li>Commit and push these changes. If your build is green, you can release.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether the abstraction is still necessary. If there's only one implementation or if it feels
            inelegant, consider removing it.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Branch by Abstraction offers a powerful alternative to traditional branching strategies. By allowing for
        incremental changes and continuous integration, it reduces risk and increases flexibility in your development
        process. Give it a try on your next big refactoring project!</p>

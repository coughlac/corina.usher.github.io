    <h1>Triple - Elevating the Pair</h1>
    <p>
        I hear pair programmers frequently mention that when there is an odd number of developers
        on their team — due to holidays, illness, or other reasons — the <em>lone developer</em> is assigned
        to housekeeping tasks or similar. This always makes me feel uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
        I dislike the <em>lone developer</em> problem, as I cannot think of many tasks
        that would warrant a developer to work on it <i>AND</i> not benefit from pairing on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a firm believer in the power of pairing for all tasks, no matter how small. Even drafting an email
        can benefit from a second perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what is the alternative?
    </p>
    <h2>3 - a magic number?</h2>
    <p>
        How about absorbing the 'lone developer' into one of our pairs? Is it that simple?
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately not.
        Simply adding a third person to the pair, without modifying any other aspect of the pairing
        process, doesn't solve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, this approach encounters similar issues to Software Teaming (Mob Programming), particularly the
        challenge of keeping all participants engaged. The person who is neither the Navigator nor the Driver often
        struggles to remain actively involved in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>I find Pair Programming to be very effective. So, why is it that the engagement level between three people,
            in the <i>same team</i>, deteriorates so quickly?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        What was going on?
    </p>
    <p> The discipline of frequent role rotations and adhering to defined roles is much harder with the introduction of
        a third person within a two role process.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my experience, the third person became a <em>third wheel,</em> typically sharing the
        Navigator role, without adding meaningful contribution. In fact, the competition for this role often diminished
        its quality, making it less effective than if the third person had simply disengaged completely, distracted by
        their phone, chat, or other distractions (another frequent observation).
    </p>
    <p>
        So what now? How do we solve the <em>lone developer</em> problem without introducing the <em>third wheel</em>
        dynamic?
    </p>
    <h2>Triple - a magic word?</h2>
    <p>
        I’d like to introduce you to a collaborative unit I refer to as a <b>Triple</b> (a nod to our use of 'Tuple' in
        pairing).
    </p>
    <p>
        What’s the key difference?
        It’s the adaptation of the traditional pairing process to encompass <em>three</em>people.
    </p>
    <p>
        More specifically, <em>it's a refinement of roles, bounded by scopes, that allows everyone to remain engaged in
        their respective responsibilities.</em>
    </p>
    <p> The redefined roles create a more focused and efficient collaborative process that
        results in improved quality, productivity and team dynamics when working in a group of three.
    </p>

    <h2>The Triple Dynamic</h2>
    <p>
        By clearly defining the roles and distinct role boundaries within a <em>Triple</em>, it eliminates the tussle
        between three people for two roles. Instead, it creates an environment
        where each team member can purposefully engage with the task at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        This structure allows for:
    <ul>
        <li>Focused execution by the Driver</li>
        <li>Immediate, task-specific guidance from the Navigator</li>
        <li>Strategic oversight and big-picture thinking from the Observer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Let's look at the roles in more detail.
    </p>

    <h3>The Driver</h3>
    <p>
        The Driver is the team member actively typing code and controlling the keyboard and mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>scope</em> is confined to the current problem and its immediate context.
        The driver focuses on the current task at hand, ignoring larger issues for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their responsibilities include:
    <ul>
        <li>Thinking about the syntax and writing the actual code</li>
        <li>Translating the Navigator's instructions and guidance into code</li>
        <li>Communicating their thoughts and actions with the rest of the <em>Triple</em> as they code</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>The Navigator</h3>
    <p>
        The Navigator observes the driver's work and provides guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>scope</em> is confined to the current problem and its immediate context
    </p>
    <p>
        Their responsibilities include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Actively review the code as it's being written, looking for bugs, syntax errors, and potential improvements
            within the scope of the current problem and its immediate context
        </li>
        <li>Keeping track of potential issues, bugs, or areas for refactoring</li>
        <li>Communicating their thoughts and actions with the rest of the <em>Triple</em> as they guide the Driver</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Observer</h3>
    <p>
        This role has been elevated to a more strategic position, focusing on strategic refactoring, architectural
        alignment, and efficiency improvements beyond the immediate task.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>scope</em> extends beyond the current task and its immediate context to encompass the potential impact
        of the changes on the entire system. This broad perspective means that the scope is not just looking at the
        impact of the change from a technical perspective, but also looking at the workflows and processes involved for
        efficiency improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their responsibilities include:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using their broader system perspective on the task at hand to identify opportunities for refactoring, or
            introducing abstractions that allow reuse in other areas of the system, simplifying the overall system
        </li>
        <li>
            Ensuring that the solution aligns with team's architectural goals and decisions, ensuring new Architectural
            Design Decision (ADRs) are recorded as necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Identify opportunities for the team to improve efficiency, including tasks suitable for automation and
            processes that may need to be challenged or re-evaluated.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preliminary Findings:</h2>
    <p>
        So far, I find the <em>Triple</em> approach more effective than the <em>Third Wheel</em> approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>Triple</em> re-balances the responsibilities of the traditional pairing roles amongst the group.
        In doing so, it leverages the inclusion of the additional person while maintaining clear lines of
        responsibility.
        This leads to a more engaged, efficient and thoughtful development processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Driver experience is on a par with that of pairing as the Navigator is focusing on their guidance.
        The Navigator role is arguably more effective as their scope is more focused.
    </p>
    <p>
        The role of the Observer does mean that their input to the <em>Triple</em> needs to be handled with care, so
        as not to overly disrupt the flow or introduce too many context shifts for the Navigator and Driver.
        Communication here is key.
    </p>
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <h3>Timing of Observations</h3>
    <p>
        Knowing when to share the findings of the Observer is crucial for maintaining workflow and balancing context
        shifts within the <em>Triple</em>. I think the next steps will be to explore the answer to the question:
    </p>
    <p>
        What are the <i>optimal</i> times to feed the Observer's findings back into the <em>Triple</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Possible suggestions could be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Commit Time:</b> when the code is being reviewed and before the narrower scope refactor</li>
        <li><b>Prior to starting the task:</b> As Kent Beck says: <em>make the change easy, then make the easy
            change.</em>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Maybe it will come down to an agreement with the people in your current <em>Triple</em> or agreed ways of
        working for the team? </p>
    <p>
        Or maybe it will be more tailored to 'how you prefer to process information'. Do you like
        to hear it and let your subconscious get to work immediately? Do you prefer to finish your train of thought
        before you get interrupted?
    </p>
    <p>
        It was suggested to me that perhaps the role of the Observer should also include observing the <em>Triple</em> session flow.
        Beyond ensuring that timely breaks are scheduled to maintain productivity and that roles are rotated to maintain
        fresh perspectives and engagement, they could interject their observations into the session at an appropriate
        time? I like the idea of this approach as it tethers the more 'meta' role of the observer back to the focus of rest of the <em>Triple</em>.
        I think I will try that out next and see how it works out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>The Future?</h2>
    <h3>Triple: The new Pair Programming?</h3>
    <p>
        The concept of a <em>Triple</em> takes on an intriguing new dimension when we think of AI as a collaborator.
        Perhaps, the Driver is the AI collaborator, and the Pair assume the roles of Navigator and Observer?
    </p>
    <p>
        A scenario where the AI model assumes the role of the Driver, generating code or content based on prompts and
        instructions.
        The developer at the keyboard becomes the Navigator, guiding the AI's output, refining prompts, and making
        real-time decisions on the generated content.
        Meanwhile, the traditional Navigator steps into the Observer role, maintaining a broader perspective on the task
        at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or alternatively, the AI collaborator is let loose in the codebase, to act as the Observer and see if it can
        suggest anything at a macro level?
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I truly am getting carried away!
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The <em>Triple</em> approach extends the benefits of Pair Programming to a slightly larger group, fostering an
        inclusive environment, enhancing perspectives, and providing more opportunities for knowledge sharing and skill
        development.
    </p>
    <p>
        It maintains our commitment to a collaborative development while ensuring no team member is redundant or doing
        mundane tasks by themselves.

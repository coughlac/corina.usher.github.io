    <h1>Continuous Integration</h1>
    <p>
        The term originated in Kent Beck’s Extreme Programming development process as one of its original 12 practices,
        back in 2000. So, it’s been around for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
        Martin Fowler defines it as:
        <i>
            a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person
            integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an
            automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible<sup><a href="#ref1"
                                                                                                        class="reference">[1]</a></sup>
        </i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of which technique you use to achieve Continuous Integration, it is good to remember why you want it
        in the first place.You are following this practise because you want:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Earlier visibility to code changes so that you can find integration issues sooner
        </li>
        <li>You want cleaner code by working on a codebase that is as ‘close to current’ as possible - pulling out
            duplication etc
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="./images/ci.png" alt="Continuous Integration" width="700">
    <p>
        Continuous integration means smaller commits, meaning smaller reviews – so hopefully shorter review cycles.
        Combined, these all help achieve faster release cycles. Faster access to feedback on your product.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what strategies are typically used to achieve CI?
    </p>

    <h2>Feature Branching</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone is quite familiar with this approach. It’s very popular. Some of you may know it as GitFlow even though
        I am sure I used it before Git’s existence.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a branching strategy that was popularised by open-source
        development, where codebases are maintained by a disparate group of people - with an unknown skill-set - and
        where there is no formal commitment on - when - or even - if - a feature will be finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, it stops features being added that have no place in the product’s roadmap.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, it is a defensive barrier put in place to protect the product and the code.
    </p>
    <img src="images/featureBranches.png" alt="Feature Branching" width="700">
    <p>
        This diagram is a somewhat simple example – in the real world we would have many features rather than just 2,
        but the idea is the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is <em>main: A single, shared, branch that acts as the current state of the product.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        A branch is created to develop Feature A. Developers work on this branch until Feature A is complete. Then the
        branch is merged back into main. To reduce the complexity of the merge of the branch back into main, developers
        typically pull changes from main into the branch regularly during the lifetime of the branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        A similar process happens for the development of Feature B. However, as Feature A has completed in the lifetime
        of the Feature B branch, all the code changes from the development of Feature A will have to be merged in one
        action with those of Feature B, either at the point its merged into main as shown here by the yellow dot or
        earlier in the lifetime of Feature B, such as the last purple dot in the diagram. Either way, the fact remains,
        that all the code changes from A need to be merged at once with those of B and this is usually a merge pain
        point.
    </p>
    <p>
        The merge is done by developers working on feature B, that may never have seen the code from Feature A before –
        increasing the risk.
    <p>
        <em>Rule of thumb:
            <ul>
                <li>The longer the feature branch has lived - the harder the merge.</li>
                <li>The more branches – the harder the merge.</li>
            </ul>
        </em>
    </p>
    In the real world where there are many long-lived feature branches – merging is generally painful.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I like about this diagram is that you can see the air gap between features being developed – integration is
        the final step of the features development – that is part of the strategy – branches give the illusion of
        isolation – you are the only one working on the product.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is usually cited as both the biggest advantage and the biggest disadvantage of this strategy. The benefit
        of isolation is traded off against late integration and merge pain. This gets to the heart of a team’s culture
        and how its people want to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        In his discussion of branching patterns, Martin Fowler recalls an old joke that says that if you fall off a tall
        building, the falling isn't going to hurt you, but the landing will. So, it is with source code: branching is
        easy, merging is harder.<sup><a href="#ref1" class="reference">[1]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        When we think about why we are using this strategy – to get the advantages of Continuous Integration – early
        detection of integration bugs, better code quality, faster review and release cycles, shared ownership, and
        collaboration – the feature branches would have to be short-lived. This is not typically the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        If feature branches are long-lived, then even if there is an automated build and test process, Continuous
        Integration is not achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you look at how Feature Branching works and the definition of Continuous Integration – it gives you a
        deferred integration, in a rather painful way and its certainly not continuous due to the delay of the review
        process. It is not really a continuous integration strategy.
    </p>
    <h2>Trunk Based Development</h2>
    <img src="./images/tbd.png"  alt="Trunk Based Development" width="700">
    <p>
        As code is frequently pushed to main, merges happen all the time, they are just smaller.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a merge conflict happens, it must be resolved and the tests re-run before the code is pushed onto main.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, due to the frequency of pushes to main, the build process around it must be fast.
        By build process I mean that the code is pulled from main, compiled and the full test suite is run by our build
        server every time we push.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is most of your CD pipeline (just not the deploy bit) which is why Continuous Integration is often talked
        about in conjunction with Continuous Delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        This strategy gives you all the advantages of Continuous Integration: early detection of integration bugs,
        better code quality, faster review and release cycles, shared ownership and collaboration, and it also sets you
        up for Continuous Delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
        So why isn’t everyone doing Trunk Based Development?
    </p>
    <h2>Common Friction Points</h2>
    <img src="./images/commonFrictionPoints.png" alt="Common Friction Points" width="700">
    <p>
        I often find that to be agile, we must be very disciplined and apply rigour to our practises.
    </p>
    <p>
        How successful we will be at those practises often depends on our team culture. Trunk Based Development is no
        exception.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jez Humble, co-author of Continuous Delivery (2011 with Dave Farley)<sup><a href="#ref2"
                                                                                    class="reference">[2]</a></sup>
        wrote that <em>trunk-based development is about putting the needs of the team above the needs of the individual.
        It is about forfeiting the illusion of isolation and adopting communication and working in small batches of
        code, in order to achieve the benefits of CI.</em> Farley himself described <em>trunk-based development as the
        practice which he gets the most push back on.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Some common concerns about adopting Trunk Based Development are:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Code Reviews</b>
            <p>
                A lot of industries require code to be reviewed before it can be released. We practice Pair
                Programming and mobbing so by default, all our code is reviewed.
                Most compliance processes accept Pair Programming commits as proof of review, so there is no
                need for a branch to satisfy that requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Code Reviews can also be done on short-lived branches (<1 day), having the benefit of a shorter review
                and so, perhaps a better quality one.
            </p>
            <p>
                An in person/call for a code review is much better than leaving comments in my opinion, as it is a
                learning/teaching opportunity, a time for discussion and collaboration, to understand why something is
                wrong rather than just what to do about it.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Can only commit code if the feature is done</b>
            <p>
                There are many strategies that allow you to release code around a feature without the entire feature
                being implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will look at a few of these in a moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                XP Practices such as MVP analysis and Incremental design can also help with this area.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>A lack of confidence in automated tests</b>
            <p>
                This assumes that you can’t test something unless its complete. Again, XP practices come into play here,
                TDD allows you to cover code as you write it. Even just writing tests to cover your code before
                committing the code is enough to give confidence here, it does not need to be test driven dev.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Separate Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        What if we just wanted a strategy for continuous integration with the ability to have code reviewed so we could
        release our application to production in the bank without pairing on everything?
    </p>
    <p>
        What if we decided that our Continuous Integration strategy should not care if it’s a feature or a bit of a
        feature, that’s a separate concern.
    </p>
    <p>
        What if we did not have a 1-2-1 relationship between a feature and a branch?
    </p>
    <p>
        This is down to the way we work.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/separateConcerns.png" alt="Separate Concerns" width="700">

    <p>
        Now our branching strategy can be closer to a true Continuous Integration solution where the branch can be
        short-lived if:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the commits are kept to a minimum (ideally 1) before being pushed to main</li>
        <li> the review is turned around quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The trade-off for not pairing on everything is the review delay. Again, down to team culture and what they
        decide works best for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        So how do you not have a 1-2-1 relationship between a feature and a branch?
    </p>
    <p>
        Breaking this relationship is key to achieving true continuous integration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s explore some techniques.
    </p>
    <h2>Strategies for Feature Development</h2>
    <img src="./images/strategiesForFeatureDev.png"alt="Strategies for Feature Development" width="700">

    <p>
        How do we go about developing features on main - when main can be released at any time?
        There are many approaches – some you are already aware of and probably use all the time: MVP, incremental
        design, feature toggles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Others you may not have heard of, - or you actually use, but not for this purpose - such as, dark launches,
        branch by abstraction and expand and contract
    </p>
    <h2>Branch by Abstraction</h2>
    <h2>What is Branch by Abstraction?</h2>

    <img src="../branchByAbstraction/images/overview.png" alt="Branch by Abstraction Diagram" height="400" width="700">
    <p>Branch by Abstraction is a method that allows you to make substantial changes to your code incrementally, without
        resorting to long-lived feature branches. This technique was coined by Stacy Curl in 2007<sup><a href="#ref3"
                                                                                                         class="reference">[3]</a></sup>
        and has since gained
        popularity among developers seeking a more flexible approach to code refactoring.</p>

    <h2>The Benefits</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Encourages gradual change</li>
        <li>Allows for continuous integration</li>
        <li>Reduces the risk associated with big bang replacements</li>
        <li>Enables easier rollback if issues arise</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Implement Branch by Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Let's break down the process step by step:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Introduce an Abstraction</h2>
    <img src="../branchByAbstraction/images/step1.png" alt="Step 1: Introduce an Abstraction" height="400" width="700">
    <ol>
        <li>Create an abstraction layer over the code you plan to change. This is typically done by extracting an
            interface.
        </li>
        <li>Update all client code to use this new abstraction instead of calling the old code directly.</li>
        <li>Commit and push your changes. If your build passes, you're good to release.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 2: Implement the New Solution</h2>
    <img src="../branchByAbstraction/images/step2.png" alt="Step 2: Implement the New Solution" height="400" width="700">
    <ol>
        <li>Develop a new implementation of the abstraction, complete with tests to ensure functionality.</li>
        <li>Commit and push this new implementation. Again, if your build is green, you can release.</li>
        <li>Gradually update client code to use the new implementation (still via the abstraction).</li>
        <li>Commit and push these changes. Release if your build passes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 3: Clean Up</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Depending on how much of the old implementation you've migrated to the abstraction, consider deprecating or
            safely deleting the original implementation.
        </li>
        <li>Commit and push these changes. If your build is green, you can release.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether the abstraction is still necessary. If there's only one implementation or if it feels
            inelegant, consider removing it.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Expand and Contract</h2>
    <h2>What is Expand and Contract?</h2>
    <img src="../expandAndContract/images/overview.png" alt="Expand and Contract Diagram" height="400" width="700">
    <p>Expand and Contract<sup><a href="#ref4" class="reference">[4]</a></sup>, also known as the Parallel Change
        pattern<sup><a href="#ref5" class="reference">[5]</a></sup> , is a well-established approach for introducing
        backward-incompatible changes. It consists of three distinct phases: expand, migrate, and contract.</p>

    <h2>The Key Benefits</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Zero downtime:</em> Incompatible changes to data structures can be deployed without any system downtime
        </li>
        <li><em>Easier testing:</em> The pattern allows running application instances with old and new code in
            parallel, making it easier to deploy and test code changes on a subset of instances first.
            Incompatible changes to data structures can be deployed without any system downtime
        </li>
        <li><em>Enables advanced release techniques:</em> The backwards compatible nature of changes allows for
            feature flags, dark launching, and canary releasing
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Expand Phase</h2>
    <img src="../expandAndContract/images/step1.png" alt="Expand Phase Diagram" height="400" width="700">
    <p>In the expand phase, the code is modified to support both old and new versions simultaneously. This allows
        existing clients to continue using the old version while new changes are introduced incrementally. For example,
        when introducing a new mandatory field in a class, it would initially be added as optional to maintain
        compatibility with the old version.</p>

    <h2>The Migrate Phase</h2>
    <img src="../expandAndContract/images/step2.png" alt="Migrate Phase Diagram" height="400" width="700">
    <p>During the migrate phase, all client code is gradually updated to use the new version, and the old version is
        deprecated. In our example, all code would now expect and be able to process the new optional field.</p>

    <h2>The Contract Phase</h2>
    <p>Once the migrate phase is complete, the old version can be removed in the contract phase. At this point, the new
        field can be made mandatory, as all code will now supply it.</p>

    <h2>Feature Toggles</h2>
    <img src="images/featureToggles.png" alt="Feature Toggling" height="400" width="700">
    <p>
        A feature toggle is basically a predicate condition that controls whether a feature is enabled or not.
        These toggles can typically be changed without having to redeploy or modify the code itself.
        They are often used to control if a new feature is available to users or to which users the feature will be
        available.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are widely used, and I am sure you are all too familiar with them. Issues with feature toggles is that
        testing can fan out, to cover permutations of toggle values and that they tend to hang around, even when they
        are no longer really needed.
    </p>
    <h2>Dark Launch</h2>
    <img src="images/darkLaunch.png" alt="Dark Launching" height="400" width="700">
    <p>
        Dark launches is a relatively new term and depending on which post you read, it can mean a variety of things
        including exposing a new feature to users via a toggle and exposing a new feature to select users via a toggle.
    </p>
    <p> I consider these cases to be just feature toggling or canary releases respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I mean by a dark launch is the original Facebook version (and the one that Martin Fowler also uses)<sup><a
            href="#ref6"
            class="reference">[6]</a></sup>. It is
        the deployment to production of code that is inaccessible to users and whose results are ignored for production
        purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, let’s concentrate on the concepts as they are the most important bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dark launches allow us to replace a feature in parallel. Both versions of the code can be called, with the
        current version still wired in to production, and the results of the new version used for reconciliation
        purposes or load timings etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        How you do this, is up to you, a toggle, branch by abstraction or expand and contract can all be
        used to achieve this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dark launches can also be used when implementing a feature in trunk that is not usable in production yet. This
        benefits developers rather than users.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may be that all you want is to be able to release to production whilst the feature development is in flight.
        So a CI benefit. Developers get early access to the changes in the code on trunk and can react to these changes
        sooner and the fact that the feature may be partially implemented is not stopping production releases.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s worth saying that if the feature in question relies on user interaction, then canary releases are probably
        a better alternative to dark launches.
    </p>
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        In a previous project, to migrate off a custom application and onto shared equivalent, we used a-->
<!--        combination of these concepts to achieve our goal.-->
<!--    </p>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        We introduced a feature toggle to be able to run the code in LEGACY, DUAL or NEW mode. In dual mode, we could-->
<!--        run the API calls to the new application each time the legacy equivalent was called and reconcile the results-->
<!--        before switching over.-->
<!--    </p>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        The results from the new version of the code were only used for rec and the old results were still used by-->
<!--        production. Once we were happy with the recs, we switched to new mode and after running for a period of time in-->
<!--        production, we removed the old code and toggle. It’s worth noting, code released as-->
<!--        a dark launch is tested code just wired in to production flows.-->
<!--    </p>-->
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <img src="images/reflections.png" alt="Reflections" width="700" >
    <p>
        What I really like about Trunk Based Development is that development flow is not disrupted by a review process.
        Our team is an agile team, and we adopt a lot of XP practises such as pair programming and mobbing. One of the
        benefits we get from these practises is that we don't have to wait an indefinite amount of time for someone to
        complete a code review.
    </p>
    <p>Instead the review is done in real-time. It encourages collaboration and discussion. You can provide
        context to the opinion you have on the code (which I think most of us are less inclined to do when we have to
        type it into a comment box).
    </p>
    <p>
        Trunk Based Development helps with discipline around Test Driven Development or in the area of automated testing
        in general. When pushing to main you are aware that if you break the build, you are breaking it for everyone, so
        you do apply more rigour to your pushes and ensure all code you are pushing is under test, all tests are run,
        and they are green.
    </p>
    <p>
        When doing Trunk Based Development, we always keep main in a releasable state. The XP practise of Incremental
        Design helps with breaking up features into smaller chunks that you can push to main and release to the users
        for feedback.
    </p>

        Have you ever wanted to rename a variable and after doing it, realised it affected a lot of files, which would
        make the merge painful for other branches due to their longevity, and backed out the change? Or worse, done it
        and been told off?
    </p>
    <p> I find this my least favourite bit of Feature Based development. </p>
    <p>
        As much as the isolation gives you security I also find it dis-empowering. Getting such changes early, allows me
        to see abstractions and domain modelling as they emerge and I can feed these changes into my design decisions
        earlier.
    </p>

        One of the main advantages of Trunk Based Development is the freedom it gives you to refactor your code without
        worrying so much about the merge impact. The earlier visibility to changes in the code that Trunk Based
        Development provides, makes this advantage even more powerful, resulting in a cleaner codebase and a more
        maintainable system.
    </p>
    <p>
        eXtreme Practices tend to complement each other and so for us, the fact that we were already pairing and doing
        Test Driven Development helped a lot with Trunk Based Development. Saying that I don’t feel you need to do both
        of those – you could just do automated testing rather than test first, and you could have short-lived branches
        for reviews and achieve a very similar result.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's worth considering Trunk Based Development if you can follow these simple guidelines – keep your build green
        and software working, have a fast build process with automated tests that cover your codebase, and your pushes
        are small and regular.

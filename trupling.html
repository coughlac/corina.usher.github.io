    <h1>Truple - Elevating the Pair</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a firm believer in the power of Pairing for all tasks, no matter how small. Even drafting an email
        can benefit from a second perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, I would even go so far as to say that Software Teaming (Mob Programming) may be my preferred
        option for use cases such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Defining the ubiquitous language of the domain model</li>
        <li>Discussing and documenting architectural designs</li>
        <li>Creating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>1 - a lone developer?</h2>
    <p>
        I frequently hear fellow Pair Programmers mention that when there is an odd number of developers
        on their team — due to holidays, illness, or other reasons — the <em>lone</em> developer is assigned
        housekeeping tasks to
        handle on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
        This always makes me feel uneasy. I dislike the <em>lone</em> developer problem, as I cannot think of many tasks
        that would warrant a developer to work on it<i>AND</i> not benefit from Pairing on it.
    </p>


    <h2>3 - a magic number?</h2>
    <p>
        I have been practising Software Teaming for several years now. As an alternative, I get teams to absorb the <em>lone</em>
        developer into one of our pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>I find Pair Programming to be very effective. So, why is it that engagement between three people, in the <i>same
            team</i>, deteriorates so quickly?</b>
    </p>
    <p>I have found that they suffer from some of the same challenges as Software Mobbing,
        particularly, a lack of engagement by the participants not actively in the roles of Navigator or Driver.<sup><a
                href="#ref1"
                class="reference">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref2" class="reference">[2]</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
        In my experience, the third person just became a <em>third wheel,</em> typically sharing the Navigator role
        without contributing anything meaningful. In fact, the competition for this role often diminishes its quality,
        making it
        less effective than if the third person had simply disengaged completely, distracted by their phone, chat, or
        other distractions (which I have found to be the other most popular outcome).
    </p>
    <h2>Truple - a magic word?</h2>
    <p>
        Rather than assigning the <em>lone</em> developer to housekeeping tasks or allowing them to become a <em>third
        wheel,</em>I’d like to introduce you to my new experiment: a collaborative unit I refer to as a <b>Truple</b> (a
        nod to our use of 'tuple' in pairing).
    </p>
    <p>
        What’s the key difference? It’s the rules. <em>More specifically, it's a refinement of roles, bounded by scopes,
        that allows everyone to remain engaged in their respective responsibilities.</em>
    </p>
    <p> Furthermore, the redefined
        roles should create a more focused and efficient collaborative process and that should result in improved
        quality, productivity and team dynamics.
    </p>

    <h2>The Truple Dynamic</h2>
    <p>
        By clearly defining the roles and distinct role boundaries within a <em>Truple</em>, it creates an environment
        where each team member can engage effectively with the task at hand, with minimal overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
        This structure allows for:
    <ul>
        <li>Focused execution by the Driver</li>
        <li>Immediate, task-specific guidance from the Navigator</li>
        <li>Strategic oversight and big-picture thinking from the Observer</li>
    </ul>
    Let's look at the roles in more detail.
    </p>

    <h3>The Driver</h3>
    <p>
        The Driver is the team member actively typing code and controlling the keyboard and mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>scope</em> is confined to the current problem and its immediate context
    </p>
    <p>
        Their responsibilities include:
    <ul>
        <li>Thinking about the syntax and writing the actual code</li>
        <li>communicating their thoughts and actions with the rest of the group as they code</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>The Navigator</h3>
    <p>
        The Navigator observes the driver's work and provides guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>scope</em> is confined to the current problem and its immediate context
    </p>
    <p>
        Their responsibilities include:
    <ul>
        <li>Reviewing the code as it's being written</li>
        <li>Keeping track of potential issues, bugs, or areas for refactoring</li>
        <li>Communicating their thoughts and actions with the rest of the group as they guide the Driver</li>
        <li>Refactors, improvements, and alternative approaches, within the scope of the Navigator
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>The Observer</h3>
    <p>
        This role has been elevated to a more strategic position. The observer is the team member actively taking a
        broader view, considering how the current changes might impact the system as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>scope</em> extends beyond the current task and its immediate context to encompass the entire system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their responsibilities include:
    <ul>
        <li>Identifying potential needs for abstraction, within the scope of the Observer</li>
        <li>Refactoring opportunities, within the scope of the Observer</li>
        <li>Architectural implications</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This refined <em>Truple</em> dynamic, re-balances the responsibilities of the traditional roles amongst the
        group.
        In doing so, it leverages the strengths of each team member while maintaining clear lines of responsibility,
        potentially leading to a more engaged, efficient and thoughtful development processes.
    </p>
    <h2>Preliminary Findings:</h2>
    <p>
        It is worth saying, that the discipline required in Pairing around role adherence and role rotation are still
        required here.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far, in my experiments with this approach, I find the role segregation definitely engages members more than
        the <em>Third Wheel</em> approach.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> The Driver experience is improved as it is only the Navigator that is focusing on their guidance.</li>
        <li> The Navigator is also more effective as their scope is more focused</li>
        <li>
            The role of the Observer does mean that their input to the <em>Truple</em> needs to be handled with care, so
            as not to overly disrupt the flow or introduce too many context shifts for the Navigator and Driver.
            Communication here is key.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
        The timing of when the Observer shares their findings or thoughts and how that impacts the flow of the session
        is key to the success of a <em>Truple</em> session.
        This can depend on the dynamic of the members or be as personal as to be tailored to 'how you prefer to process
        information'.
        Do you like to hear it and let your subconscious get to work immediately? Do you prefer to finish your train of
        thought before you get interrupted? Something else? What works best for all 3 of you?
    </p>
    <h3>Timing of Observations</h3>
    <p>
        Knowing when to introduce changes or suggestions is crucial for maintaining workflow. It is best to agree the
        preferred timings before the start of the session. A lot of this will come down to your own judgement, the
        people in your current <em>Truple</em>, agreed ways of working for the team and practise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Possible suggestions could be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Commit Time:</b> when the code is being reviewed and before the narrower scope refactor</li>
        <li><b>Prior to starting the task:</b> As Kent Beck philosophises: <em>make the change easy, then make the easy
            change.</em>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Balancing Context Shifts and Flow</h3>
    <p>
        To manage the balance between micro context shifts and maintaining productivity:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Regular Check-ins:</b> Schedule brief, periodic discussions to address potential changes without
            disrupting flow.
        </li>
        <li><b>Clear Communication:</b> Ensure all team members understand when and how suggestions will be
            incorporated.
        </li>
        <li><b>Flexibility:</b> Be ready to adjust roles and timing based on team needs and project requirements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What next?</h2>
    <h3>Truple: The new Pair Programming?</h3>
    <p>
        The concept of a <em>Truple</em> takes on an intriguing new dimension when we think of AI as a collaborator.
        Perhaps, the Driver is the AI collaborator, and the Pair assume the roles of Navigator and Observer?
        A scenario where the AI model assumes the role of the Driver, generating code or content based on prompts and
        instructions.
        The developer at the keyboard becomes the Navigator, guiding the AI's output, refining prompts, and making
        real-time decisions on the generated content.
        Meanwhile, the traditional Navigator steps into the Observer role, maintaining a broader perspective on the task
        at hand.

        Or alternatively, the AI collaborator is let loose in the codebase, to act as the Observer and see if it can
        suggest anything at a macro level?
        It may not be quite at that stage yet, but soon perhaps? An experiment for the future
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The <em>Truple</em> approach extends the benefits of Pair Programming to a slightly larger group, fostering an
        inclusive environment, enhancing perspectives, and providing more opportunities for knowledge sharing and skill
        development.
        We maintain our commitment to collaborative development while ensuring no team member is redundant or doing
        mundane tasks by themselves.

<h1>Software Teaming</h1>
<h2> A Personal Journey</h2>
<p>
    Software Teaming on tasks beyond spiking and whiteboard sessions can be effective, but its success heavily depends
    on team composition, maturity, and size. My experience with a small, established team that regularly paired on all
    tasks provides valuable insights into this process.

    Our team was merging with another small group from a related domain, who were unfamiliar with pair programming.
    Initially, our attempt at Software Teaming resembled more of a "mob" than a cohesive team effort.
</p>

<h2>First impressions</h2>
<p>
    The initial sessions were chaotic:
<ul>
    <li> Team members spoke over each other</li>
    <li> Non-drivers competed for the Navigator role</li>
    <li> Highlighting minor errors turned into a competitive sport</li>
    <li> Conflicting personalities created an uncomfortable atmosphere</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2>Engagement</h2>
<p>
    One of the most frustrating aspects I've encountered is the inconsistent engagement of team members. When it's their
    turn to navigate or drive, some participants seem lost or disconnected. This leads to an uneven dynamic where some
    team members step up to help, while others disengage further.
</p>
<p>
    In some cases, individuals start solving tasks independently on their machines, merely dictating solutions to the
    rest of the team. This approach undermines the collective learning process that's central to Software Teaming.
    This lack of engagement can quickly erode the benefits of Software Teaming.
</p>
<p>
    It raises questions about whether team members feel their presence adds value, or if they believe they need to be
    there at all?
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps a retrospective or post-mortem could shed light on these issues?
</p>
<p>
    It's also worth considering, if the team feels psychologically safe to collaborate? Especially if the group is newly
    formed, or if there are underlying issues with team composition.
</p>
<h4>External Factors and Distractions</h4>
<p>
    It's important to note that engagement issues aren't always the fault of individual team members.
</p>
<p>
    Often, the entire team couldn't fully commit to our Software Teaming sessions due to competing priorities. Meetings,
    chat channels, and interactions with other teams frequently caused distractions and side conversations, sometimes
    even spawning "side mobs."
</p>
<p>
    The presence of phones and laptops in our teaming space (usually a meeting room) exacerbated these distractions.
</p>
<h4>Maintaining Discipline and Focus</h4>
<p>
    Maintaining discipline across the entire team regarding rotation and role adherence remains a significant challenge.
    This often results in uneven participation, with dominant team members taking over and a general loss of focus.
</p>
<p>
    The pressure of performing in front of an audience, no matter how friendly, can be daunting. This feeling is
    amplified in teams with significant skill disparities.
</p>
<p>
    Despite efforts to create a safe, collaborative environment, newcomers to Software Teaming often find it
    intimidating, likening it to a technical test or feeling like they're constantly under scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
    While practice and time help, some individuals may always find this aspect challenging, similar to experiences with
    pair programming. As someone who enjoys Pairing, I'm still adapting to the 'team' aspect of Software Teaming.
</p>
<h2>Behavioural Change</h2>
<p>
    Recognizing that we had issues adopting Software Teaming as a practise, we took a step back to reflect on our
    journey as a team.
</p>
<p>
    What could we do differently to make things better?
</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
    Importantly, we realised that many of our challenges were not inherent to Software Teaming but were symptoms of our
    new team dynamics and broader transition.
</p>
<p>
    Learning a new technology or language or domain is hard. Teaching it is harder. All of it, will take time.
    We are going to be slow for a while. A good while.
</p>
<p>
    Luckily, we did all like each other, we simply were not used to working with each other yet. We did not understand
    each other's personalities and mannerisms. We did not know where our skills complemented each other or needed
    bolstering.
</p>
<p>
    We acknowledged that learning new language, business domain, team dynamics, and ways of working would take time.
    Learning a new anything - technology or language or domain is hard. Teaching it is harder. Doing several at once, is
    harder again. We are going to be slow for a while. A good while. All of it, will take time.
</p>
<p>
    So, that is all well and good but, the question remains. What could we do differently to make things better?
</p>
<h3>Establishing Ground Rules</h3>
<p>
    To address the issues we faced, we agreed some ground rules. We adapted them as we went, as should you, but they
    were essentially:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Avoid speaking simultaneously to ensure everyone is heard</li>
    <li> Allow the session to flow naturally, looking for appropriate moments to interject</li>
    <li> Give the driver time to self-correct minor errors (count to 10 if necessary)</li>
    <li> Encourage diverse participation, avoiding domination by a single voice</li>
    <li> Pace the session to accommodate the least experienced team member</li>
    <li> Regularly rotate roles to maintain engagement and fairness</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Rocky Path to Success</h2>
<p>
    By continuously adapting these rules and maintaining a reflective approach, we found that Software Teaming could be
    an effective tool for our team. For certain use cases, our team had better collaboration, improved knowledge
    sharing, and ultimately better outcomes.
</p>
<p>
    Software Teaming worked well for us, when we were spiking out some solutions for a problem or trying to reach
    agreement on a topic, be it an architectural or domain topic. However, when applying Software Teaming to every task,
    every day, the engagement issues remained a problem. This was mainly on tasks that were not exploratory nor needing
    the team to come to a unanimous decision on a topic.
</p>
<p>
    At times, it seemed less effective than Pairing on this category of tasks. The additional discipline required to
    engage the larger group and the frustration with the lack of it, disrupted the flow of the sessions without any
    clear benefit.
</p>

<h2> Next Steps </h2>
<p>
    My journey with Software Teaming continues, as I believe the process has merit. However, in my experience, it
    becomes increasingly challenging with teams larger than about six people. Keeping a large group engaged for extended
    periods is difficult, and Software Teaming is no exception.
</p>
<p>
    To address these challenges, I am considering the following approaches:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Start with smaller tasks:</b> Begin Software Teaming on tasks that would typically be spikes or whiteboard
        sessions
    </li>
    <li><b>Rotate roles frequently:</b> This keeps everyone engaged and prevents dominant personalities from taking over
    </li>
    <li><b>Create a distraction-free environment:</b> Establish ground rules for device usage and external interruptions
        during sessions
    </li>
    <li><b>Regular retrospectives:</b> Conduct frequent check-ins specifically on the topic of the team's adoption of
        Software Teaming.
    </li>
    <li><b>Gradually increase complexity:</b> As the team becomes more comfortable, introduce more complex tasks</li>
    <li><b>Mix methodologies:</b> Pair on other tasks, then reflect and reassess the approach</li>
</ul>
<p>
    By acknowledging these challenges and actively working to overcome them, teams can harness the full potential of
    Software Teaming while creating a more inclusive and productive development environment.
</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Software Teaming requires patience and adaptation</li>
    <li>Regular reflection and adjustment are crucial for success</li>
    <li>Clear ground rules help manage team dynamics</li>
    <li>The process can be highly effective when tailored to the team's needs</li>
    <li>Just because you can use it for everything, all the time, does not mean
        that you have to, especially all at once. Gradual, incremental change is good.
    </li>
</ul>

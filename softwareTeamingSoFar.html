<h1>Software Teaming (Mob Programming)</h1>
<h2>What is Software Teaming?</h2>
<p>
    Woody Zuill, a pioneer in this field, defines Software Teaming as:
</p>
<p>
    <em>A collaborative approach where the entire team works together on most tasks, progressing directly from concept
        to completed and deployed software. This method eliminates inefficiencies such as queuing, inventory buildup,
        and multitasking. It's crucial to have a team with all necessary skills and knowledge. While team members may
        occasionally work individually or in pairs, the majority of work is done collaboratively.</em><sup><a

</p>

<h2>A Personal Journey</h2>
<h3>Why did we try it?</h3>
<p>I like to work closely with the business when developing a product, so that I can understand the domain and deliver
    value, incrementally.
    The idea of the entire team, including the business people in our 'teaming' sessions, with real-time input from them
    in our sessions, was very appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
    Would I get a better understanding of the product? Would the team naturally acquire a ubiquitous language with the
    business? Would we get a better product? Was this the replacement for pairing?</p>
<h3>First impressions</h3>
<p>
    My experience with Software Teaming began with a small, established team that regularly paired on
    all tasks.

    This team was merging with another small team from a related business domain, who were unfamiliar with pairing.
</p>
<p>
    At first, our attempts at Software Teaming resembled more of a "mob" than a cohesive team effort.
</p>
<p>
    The initial sessions were chaotic:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Team members spoke over each other</li>
    <li> Non-drivers competed for the Navigator role</li>
    <li> Highlighting minor errors turned into a competitive sport</li>
    <li> Conflicting personalities created an uncomfortable atmosphere</li>
</ul>
<h2>Engagement</h2>
<p>
    One of the most frustrating aspects I've encountered with Software Teaming is the inconsistent engagement of team
    members. When it's their turn to navigate or drive, some participants seem lost or disconnected. This leads to an
    uneven dynamic where some team members step up to help, while others disengage further.
</p>
<p>
    In some cases, individuals start solving tasks independently on their machines, merely dictating solutions to the
    rest of the team. This approach undermines the collective learning process that's central to Software Teaming.
    This lack of engagement can quickly erode the benefits of Software Teaming.
</p>
<p>
    It raises questions about whether team members feel their presence adds value, or if they believe they need to be
    there at all?
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps a retrospective or post-mortem could shed light on these issues?
</p>
<p>
    It's also worth considering, if the team feels psychologically safe to collaborate? Especially if the group is newly
    formed, or if there are underlying issues with team composition.
</p>
<h3>External Factors and Distractions</h3>
<p>
    It's important to note that engagement issues aren't always the fault of individual team members.
</p>
<p>
    Often, the entire team couldn't fully commit to our Software Teaming sessions due to competing priorities. Meetings,
    chat channels, and interactions with other teams frequently caused distractions and side conversations, sometimes
    even spawning "side mobs."
</p>
<p>
    The presence of phones and laptops in our teaming space (usually a meeting room) exacerbated these distractions.
</p>
<h3>Maintaining Discipline and Focus</h3>
<p>
    Maintaining discipline across the entire team regarding rotation and role adherence remains a significant challenge.
    This often results in uneven participation, with dominant team members taking over and a general loss of focus.
</p>
<p>
    The pressure of performing in front of an audience, no matter how friendly, can be daunting. This feeling is
    amplified in teams with significant skill disparities.
</p>
<p>
    Despite efforts to create a safe, collaborative environment, newcomers to Software Teaming often find it
    intimidating, likening it to a technical test or feeling like they're constantly under scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
    While practice and time help, some individuals may always find this aspect challenging, similar to experiences with
    Pair Programming. As someone who enjoys Pairing, it took me a long time to adapt to the 'team' aspect of Software
    Teaming.
</p>
<h2>Behavioural Change</h2>
<p>
    In those initial sessions, we quickly recognised that we had issues adopting Software Teaming as a practise.
    We took a step back to reflect on our journey as a team.
</p>
<p>
    <em>What could we do differently to make things better?</em>
</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
    Importantly, we realised that many of our challenges were not inherent to Software Teaming but were symptoms of our
    new team dynamics and broader transition.
</p>
<p>
    Learning a new technology or language or domain is hard. Teaching it is harder. All of it, will take time.
    We are going to be slow for a while. A good while.
</p>
<p>
    Luckily, we did all like each other, we simply were not used to working with each other, yet. We did not understand
    each other's personalities and mannerisms. We did not know where our skills complemented each other or needed
    bolstering.
</p>
<p>
    We acknowledged that learning a new language, business domain and 'ways of working' would each take time. Learning
    our new team dynamics would also take time.
</p>
<p>
    Learning a new <i>anything</i> - technology or language or domain is hard. Teaching it is harder. Doing several at
    once, is harder again. </p>
<p>
    We are going to be <i>slow</i> for a while. A good while. All of it, will take time.
</p>
<p>
    So, that is all well and good but, the question remains. <em>What could we do differently to make things
    better?</em>
</p>
<h3>Establishing Ground Rules</h3>
<p>
    To address the issues we faced, we agreed some ground rules. We adapted them as we went, as should you, but they
    were essentially:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Regularly rotate roles to maintain engagement and fairness</li>
    <li> Give the driver time to self-correct minor errors (count to 10 if necessary)</li>
    <li> Avoid speaking simultaneously to ensure everyone is heard</li>
    <li> Encourage diverse participation, avoiding domination by a single voice</li>
    <li> Allow the session to flow naturally, looking for appropriate moments to interject</li>
    <li> Pace the session to accommodate the least experienced team member</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Outcome</h2>
<p>
    By continuously adapting these rules and maintaining a reflective approach, we found that Software Teaming could be
    an effective tool for our team. For certain use cases, our team had better collaboration, improved knowledge
    sharing, and ultimately better outcomes.
</p>
<p>
    Software Teaming worked well for us, when we were spiking out solutions for a problem or trying to reach
    agreement on a topic, be it an architectural or domain topic.
</p>
<p>
    When Software Teaming was applied to tasks outside of these categories, engagement issues were more prevalent.
    The extra effort needed to involve the larger group, coupled with frustration over lack of engagement, often
    disrupted the flow of sessions without providing clear benefits. In some cases, it appeared less effective than
    Pairing for such tasks.
</p>
<h2>The Path Ahead</h2>
<p>
    Since this introduction to Software Teaming a few years ago now, I've participated in Software Teaming across
    various teams with diverse dynamics. While these sessions have been less chaotic than my initial experiences, they
    consistently face challenges around uneven levels of engagement. It is still a journey I am on and a process I am
    iterating over.
</p>
<p>
    By acknowledging challenges and actively working to overcome them, teams can harness the full potential of
    Software Teaming while creating a more inclusive and productive development environment.
</p>
<p>
    There are some key learnings from my journey so far:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Software Teaming requires patience and adaptation</li>
    <li>Regular reflection and adjustment are crucial for success</li>
    <li>Clear ground rules help manage team dynamics</li>
    <li>Role adherence and role rotation are key to engagement</li>
    <li>The evolutionary stage of the team, it's dynamics, size and practises are very influential factors in Software
        Teaming
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
    I am currently applying the following guidelines to Software Teaming:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Start with smaller tasks:</b> Begin Software Teaming on tasks that would typically be spikes or whiteboard
        sessions
    </li>
    <li><b>Rotate roles frequently:</b> This keeps everyone engaged and prevents dominant personalities from taking over
    </li>
    <li><b>Create a distraction-free environment:</b> Establish ground rules for device usage and external interruptions
        during sessions
    </li>
    <li><b>Regular targeted retrospectives:</b> Conduct frequent check-ins specifically on the topic of the team's
        adoption of Software Teaming.
    </li>
    <li><b>Gradually increase complexity:</b> As the team becomes more comfortable, introduce more complex tasks</li>
    <li><b>Mix methodologies:</b> Pair on other tasks, then reflect and reassess the approach</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    My journey with Software Teaming will continue, as I believe the process has merit. Keeping a large group engaged
    for extended periods is difficult, and Software Teaming is no exception.
</p>
<p>
    I still have some outstanding questions.
    Are certain situations more suited to Software Teaming over Pairing or vice versa?
    Is Software Teaming like Pairing, but at scale?
